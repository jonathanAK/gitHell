Out the door just in time
Head down the 405
Gotta meet the new boss by 8 A.M.
The phone rings in the car
The wife is working hard
She's running late tonight again
Well, I know what I've been told
You gotta work to feed the soul
But I can't do this all on my own
No, I know, I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman
You've got your love online
You think you're doing fine
But you're just plugged into the wall
And that deck of tarot cards
Won't get you very far
There ain't no hand to break your fall
Well, I know what I've been told
You gotta know just when to fold
But I can't do this all on my own
No, I know, I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman
That's right
You've crossed the finish line
Won the race but lost your mind
Was it worth it after all?
I need you here with me
'Cause love is all we need
Just take a hold of the hand
That breaks the fall
Well, I know what I've been told
Gotta break free to break the mold
But I can't do this all on my own
No, I can't do this all on my own
I know that I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman, I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman
(Someday)
(Someday we'll be together)
(Someday)
I'm no Superman
